This site was built using github-pages, jekyll, and a lot of googling. In this post I'm going to note some of the resources I used, for my own benefit if nothing else.

It's really easy to use github-pages to set up a simple site. It also uses jekyll, which allows for pages to be writted in markdown. But it won't allow jekyll plugins, so I switched form the default to a two-branch system described by [Drew Silcock](https://drewsilcock.co.uk/custom-jekyll-plugins/).
